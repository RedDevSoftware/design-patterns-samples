# Factory

This pattern is applied when it is necessary to create objects or as its name indicates to manufacture, objects during the execution of our development.

### Example:

We have the situation what several construction companies request an application where want to obtain materials, start and stop construction, but these construction companies have only one type of construction:
Constructora A -> Building
Constructora B -> Houses
Constructora C -> Bridges

Note: Try not to generate duplicates, or develop multiple applications for each constructor. Also possible other companies want get into to application.
